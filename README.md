# -Smart-Object-Detection-Using-Multimodal-Data-For-Assistance-System

The safety of autonomous vehicles along with traffic
monitoring systems is of utmost importance, especially when
it comes to identifying obstacles like other vehicles and road
dividers. Here system designed for real-time object detection
employing the YOLOv5n model combined with an ultrasonic
sensor to measure distances, all implemented on a Raspberry
Pi platform. By effectively recognizing objects and determining
their distance from the sensor in real-time, this technology
seeks to improve the detection of cars and dividers. While
the ultrasonic sensor determines the distance to the identified
objects, the YOLOv5n model can identify and classify items
in a live video feed. The label of the object, the confidence
score, and the distance from the sensor are the three primary
pieces of information the system delivers for each detection. The
technology helps identify possible risks, including cars or dividers
in real vehicle systems and intelligent traffic management, by
combining object detection with distance data. The results from
experiments underscore the systemâ€™s proficiency in real-time
object detection and distance measurement, emphasizing its
potential to bolster safety in applications related to autonomous
driving and traffic surveillance.
